## Task 1

The student and staff of IIUM are having a hard time in managing their venues reservation for
class activities and other co-curriculum activities. The staff and student of IIUM notified 
the authorities in the needs to have an online system, where they could easily reserve a venue 
for their own activities without a big hassle of manually registering at the department. 
The IIUM authority would like to work on a new management system for booking a venue to 
meet these demands. They also would like to optimize the work for IIUM Facilities, Food and
Service Department, as these new system would also prevent a conflict in booking, automation of 
service and protecting the integrity of data.
